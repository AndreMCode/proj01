Unity version:      2022.3.56f1

This game is a first-person shooter with the main objective being to survive each level and
defeat all enemies. The player is given 5 health at the start of each level. Enemies launch
fireballs at the player and the player takes 1 point of damage if hit. Health pick ups
occasionally spawn in the center of the area, giving the player an opportunity to heal
by 1 health point. The number of enemies that must be defeated by the player and the enemy
travel speed both increase with each level and, at a lesser rate, the maximum number of
enemy instances allowed at one time. If the player completes a level that is a multiple of
5, a checkpoint is set for the proceeding level from which the player may continue the game
should the player fail or quit. The game tops out at level 50. Enemies spawn from green
flame spawn points, and spawn points increase late-game.
